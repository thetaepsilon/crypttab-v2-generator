<presetname>/
	<optional sourcedev [1]>
		-- if not specified, uses an LVM name expecting a "/dev/disk/local" symlink.
		-- e.g. for preset files.home.foo, defaults to /dev/disk/local/files.home.foo.
	<optional mapped name>
		-- again derives from preset name.
		-- if not specified, probably something like:
		-- /dev/mapper/crypttab_$presetname_$time.
		-- this system controls generation of the mount point units so this is fine,
		-- however the admin may want a more predictable path.
	<optional key name and path overrides>
		-- in keeping with the "master key store" idea,
		-- there is a default global directory where keys will be searched.
		-- the key name will default to "cryptkey_$preset.bin" under this directory.
	<target mount point>
		-- the only mandatory argument here, label is self explanatory.
		-- required because it is expected that other units
		-- will pull in the mount points that this generator configures,
		-- for the original idea of on-demand lock but asynchronously.

To allow for the setup of said /dev/disk/local symlink,
the generated units should depend on some target unit to allow this to be created.
Said target unit can then have local fragments which make it depend on other services,
to set up the symlink to e.g. the appropriate LVM group like /dev/lvm_vgXY.
